## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Reads & Summarizes Treaty Wordings**

   * Instantly parses complex reinsurance contracts, cedent submissions, and historical losses.
   * Produces structured, underwriter‑ready summaries.

2. **RL‑Based Treaty Structure Optimization**

   * Simulates thousands of treaty variations (retentions, limits, layers).
   * Identifies structures that maximize ROI under tail‑risk constraints.

3. **Interactive What‑If Analysis**

   * Adjust key parameters (e.g., attachment point).
   * See immediate impact on **expected loss** and **projected ROI**.

4. **Conversational AI for Treaty Design**

   * Chat naturally with **Aiden**:

     > “What if we split into two layers instead?”
   * Streaming, human‑like responses with context awareness.

5. **Final Recommendation + Risk Heatmap**

   * Aiden recommends the **top structure** with rationale.
   * Visual **risk vs. return landscape** and heatmaps for intuitive decision‑making.
